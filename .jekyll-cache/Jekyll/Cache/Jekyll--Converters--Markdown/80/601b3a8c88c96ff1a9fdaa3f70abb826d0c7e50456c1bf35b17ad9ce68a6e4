I"Æ<p>Soâ€¦welcome to the blog.</p>

<p>This is a space for me (<a href="https://twitter.com/Jae_Noza">@Jae_Noza</a>) to post about tabletop games.</p>

<p>Mostly, this is here to try and force a little accountability for all of the various game designs Iâ€™m working on.</p>

<p><em>Matachin Games</em> is not really a thing, at least not yet, but it has a name for the same reason that this blog exists: so that thereâ€™s some record out there in the ether for me to point to.</p>

<p>I plan to spit out my notes, ideas, and thoughts about my games here as I work on them. There are also quite a few other games out there that donâ€™t get the attention they deserve so I hope to write little bits about them here too.</p>

<p>Right now, all you can do is head over to the <a href="/games/">Games</a> section for an overview of the main projects Iâ€™m working on now. Theyâ€™re all in different states of development and disarray but theyâ€™re there (or will be)!</p>
