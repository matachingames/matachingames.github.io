<h3 id="a-cooperative-miniatures-game-of-daring-hunts">A Cooperative Miniatures Game of Daring Hunts</h3>
<p>In <em>Cazadores</em>, each player creates a single Cazador, a brave and formidable hunter hellbent on hunting and defeating fearsome mythical beasts, twisted beings, uncanny horrors, and other terrifying Adversaries. Cazadores are joined by a rare few Companions willing to follow them into the wilderness, through the desert, across mountains, into the lairs of monstrous things, and the darkness between the planes.</p>

<p><em>Cazadores</em> is a narrative-focused game that can be played solo or cooperatively. It only requires 1-4 miniatures per side and a 24‚Äùx24‚Äù space, making it a perfect kitchen table game and introduction to those new to the miniatures hobby.</p>

<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A simple d10 dice pool system that resolves actions in a single roll (e.g., to hit, damage, and modifiers)</li>
  <li>A Time-based initiative system where actions cost ‚ÄúTicks‚Äù contributing to a more dynamic flow for combat.</li>
  <li>Streamlined stats and decision trees that make Foes‚Äô actions easy to determine and execute.</li>
  <li>Unique attacks and abilities for Adversaries using a standard deck of playing cards to make them special and intriguing enemies.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="design-goals">Design Goals</h4>
<p>The game was inspired by my desire to get more use out of miniatures from big box board games, usually from Kickstarter, like <em>Blood Rage</em>, <em>Kingdom Death Monster</em>, etc., that just don‚Äôt see the table that often.</p>

<p>The current version is an early draft with only one Adversary to take on but more are coming and the guts of the system are there. With a little imagination you can run with this to set up your own Hunts.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this as much as I have so far. If you do take it for a spin, make sure to let me know: <a href="mailto:matachingames@disroot.org">matachingames@disroot.org</a></p>
