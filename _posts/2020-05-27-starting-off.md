So...welcome to the blog.

This is a space for me ([@Jae_Noza](https://twitter.com/Jae_Noza)) to post about tabletop games.

Mostly, this is here to try and force a little accountability for all of the various game designs I'm working on. 

*Matachin Games* is not really a thing, at least not yet, but it has a name for the same reason that this blog exists: so that there's some record out there in the ether for me to point to. 

I plan to spit out my notes, ideas, and thoughts about my games here as I work on them. There are also quite a few other games out there that don't get the attention they deserve so I hope to write little bits about them here too.

Right now, all you can do is head over to the [Games](/games/) section for an overview of the main projects I'm working on now. They're all in different states of development and disarray but they're there (or will be)!
