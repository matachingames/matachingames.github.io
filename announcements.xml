   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So…welcome to the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a space for me (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jae_Noza&quot;&gt;@Jae_Noza&lt;/a&gt;) to post about tabletop games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, this is here to try and force a little accountability for all of the various game designs I’m working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matachin Games&lt;/em&gt; is not really a thing, at least not yet, but it has a name for the same reason that this blog exists: so that there’s some record out there in the ether for me to point to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to spit out my notes, ideas, and thoughts about my games here as I work on them. There are also quite a few other games out there that don’t get the attention they deserve so I hope to write little bits about them here too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, all you can do is head over to the &lt;a href=&quot;/games/&quot;&gt;Games&lt;/a&gt; section for an overview of the main projects I’m working on now. They’re all in different states of development and disarray but they’re there (or will be)!&lt;/p&gt;
